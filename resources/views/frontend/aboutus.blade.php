                    DC allow your custom module to provide demo nodes as soon as the module is installed - this helps with populating blocks, views, and generally showcasing your module's functionality. This is very useful when showcasing a module's functionality to a client. For example, rather than installing the Forum module and having to manually create forum nodes, the DC API can be used to pre-populate the site with forum-type nodes as soon as the Forum module is enabled. Additionally, rather than having purely Lorem Ipsum-type content, you can define relevant pieces of text and images, giving the content a more complete & realistic look & feel
